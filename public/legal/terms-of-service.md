## 1. Introduction and Acceptance

These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you ("Customer," "you," or "your") and **Adam Shriki LTD**, Company No. 515963320, a company incorporated under the laws of the State of Israel ("Company," "we," "us," or "our"), governing your access to and use of the LynxPoker web application, mobile applications, APIs, and related services (collectively, the "Service").

By creating an account, accessing, or using the Service, you represent that you have the legal authority to bind the organization on whose behalf you are acting and that you accept these Terms in full. If you do not agree, you must not access or use the Service.

## 2. Description of Service

### 2.1 Purpose

LynxPoker is a **business-to-business (B2B) software-as-a-service (SaaS) platform** designed to assist professional tournament staff — including Floor Managers, Tournament Directors, and Dealers — in managing live, in-person poker tournaments. The Service functions as a digital scoreboard, tournament clock, blind structure manager, player registration tracker, dealer assignment tool, and reporting utility.

### 2.2 What LynxPoker Is NOT

**LynxPoker does not constitute a gambling platform, online poker room, or financial services provider.** Specifically, the Service:

- Does **not** facilitate, process, hold, or transmit any buy-ins, entry fees, payouts, wagers, or real-money transactions of any kind;
- Does **not** operate, host, or enable any form of online or remote gambling;
- Does **not** act as a payment processor, escrow agent, or financial intermediary;
- Does **not** determine or influence the outcome of any poker game or tournament;
- Does **not** provide poker gameplay functionality — no cards are dealt, no hands are played, and no wagering occurs through the Service.

The Service is analogous to a digital whiteboard or scorekeeping system. All financial transactions, prize distributions, and game operations occur independently of and outside the Service, under the sole control and responsibility of the Customer.
